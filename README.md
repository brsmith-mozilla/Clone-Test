# lean-data-practices
Lean Data Practices for Civil Society Organizations is toolkit for advocacy organizations to review their data collection practices in an effort to create trust with their membership base and mitigate security risks.

### Why lean data?
Lean Data Practices (“LDP”) are a technique to manage data.  You don’t need an engineering degree or a dedicated budget to apply LDP.  All you need is a commitment from your organization to think through data decisions thoughtfully.  The pay-off? LDP helps you build trust with members and reduces operational risk.  

**Increased Trust** <br/>
Members are much less likely to take actions or use services of organizations they don’t trust. Once trust is lost, it is hard -- and sometimes impossible -- to regain.

**Reduced Risk** <br/>
Every additional byte you store increases your operating costs and the costs to deal with a data or security breach (like legal fees, fines, credit monitoring services, etc.).
