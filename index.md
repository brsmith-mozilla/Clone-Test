### Why Lean Data Practices?

Lean Data Practices are a technique to manage data to help you build trust with members and reduce operational risk. You don’t need an engineering degree or a dedicated budget to apply these practices.  All you need is a commitment from your organization to think through data decisions thoughtfully. 

**Increased Trust**<br/>
Members are much less likely to take actions or use services of organizations they don’t trust. Once trust is lost, it's hard -- ifnot impossible -- to regain.

**Reduced Risk**<br/>
Every additional byte you store increases your operating costs and the costs to deal with a data or security breach (like legal fees, fines, credit monitoring services, etc.).

### What's in the toolkit?
