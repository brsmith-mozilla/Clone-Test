# Participation Guidelines

The heart of Mozilla is people. We put people first and do our best to recognize, appreciate and respect the diversity of our global contributors. The Mozilla Project welcomes contributions from everyone who shares our goals and wants to contribute in a healthy and constructive manner within our community. As such, we have adopted this code of conduct and require all those who participate to agree and adhere to these Community Participation Guidelines in order to help us create a safe and positive community experience for all. 

This project respects Mozilla's [community participation guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/). These guidelines cover our behaviour as participants, facilitators, space wranglers, staff, volunteers, vendors, and anyone else involved in making the MozFest possible.

These guidelines aim to support a community where all people should feel safe to participate, introduce new ideas and inspire others, regardless of:

  * Background
  * Family status
  * Gender
  * Gender identity or expression
  * Marital status
  * Sex
  * Sexual orientation
  * Native language
  * Age
  * Ability
  * Race and/or ethnicity
  * National origin
  * Socioeconomic status
  * Religion
  * Geographic location
  * Any other dimension of diversity

Openness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work â€” from development on Firefox to collaboratively designing curriculum. We gain strength from diversity and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. These guidelines exist to enable diverse individuals and groups to interact and collaborate to mutual advantage. This document outlines both expected and prohibited behavior.
